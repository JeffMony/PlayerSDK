SoundTouch audio processing library v1.9.2

SoundTouch library Copyright Â© Olli Parviainen 2001-2015

1. Introduction

SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library that allows changing the sound tempo, pitch and playback rate parameters independently from each other, i.e.:

Sound tempo can be increased or decreased while maintaining the original pitch
Sound pitch can be increased or decreased while maintaining the original tempo
Change playback rate that affects both tempo and pitch at the same time
Choose any combination of tempo/pitch/rate

2. Compiling SoundTouch

Before compiling, notice that you can choose the sample data format if it's desirable to use floating point sample data instead of 16bit integers. See section "sample data format" for more information.

Also notice that SoundTouch can use OpenMP instructions for parallel computation to accelerate the runtime processing speed in multi-core systems, however, these improvements need to be separately enabled before compiling. See OpenMP notes in Chapter 3 below.

2.1. Building in Microsoft Windows

Project files for Microsoft Visual C++ are supplied with the source code package. Go to Microsoft WWW page to download Microsoft Visual Studio Express version for free.

To build the binaries with Visual C++ compiler, either run "make-win.bat" script, or open the appropriate project files in source code directories with Visual Studio. The final executable will appear under the "SoundTouch\bin" directory. If using the Visual Studio IDE instead of the make-win.bat script, directories bin and lib may need to be created manually to the SoundTouch package root for the final executables. The make-win.bat script creates these directories automatically.

OpenMP NOTE: If activating the OpenMP parallel computing in the compilation, the target program will require additional vcomp dll library to properly run. In Visual C++ 9.0 these libraries can be found in the following folders.

x86 32bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist\x86\Microsoft.VC90.OPENMP\vcomp90.dll
x64 64bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist\amd64\Microsoft.VC90.OPENMP\vcomp90.dll
In Visual Studio 2008, a SP1 version may be required for these libraries. In other VC++ versions the required library will be expectedly found in similar "redist" location.

Notice that as minor demonstration of a "dll hell" phenomenon both the 32-bit and 64-bit version of vcomp90.dll have the same filename but different contents, thus choose the proper version to allow the program start.

2.2. Building in Gnu platforms

The SoundTouch library compiles in practically any platform supporting GNU compiler (GCC) tools. SoundTouch requires GCC version 4.3 or later.

To build and install the binaries, run the following commands in /soundtouch directory:

./bootstrap  -
Creates "configure" file with local autoconf/automake toolset.
./configure  -
Configures the SoundTouch package for the local environment. Notice that "configure" file is not available before running the "./bootstrap" command as above.
make         -
Builds the SoundTouch library & SoundStretch utility. You can optionally add "-j" switch after "make" to speed up the compilation in multi-core systems.

make install -
Installs the SoundTouch & BPM libraries to /usr/local/lib and SoundStretch utility to /usr/local/bin. Please notice that 'root' privileges may be required to install the binaries to the destination locations.

2.2.1 Required GNU tools 

Bash shell, GNU C++ compiler, libtool, autoconf and automake tools are required for compiling the SoundTouch library. These are usually included with the GNU/Linux distribution, but if not, install these packages first. For example, Ubuntu Linux can acquire and install these with the following command:

sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool build-essential
2.2.2 Problems with GCC compiler compatibility

At the release time the SoundTouch package has been tested to compile in GNU/Linux platform. However, If you have problems getting the SoundTouch library compiled, try disabling optimizations that are specific for x86 processors by running ./configure script with switch

--enable-x86-optimizations=no
Alternatively, if you don't use GNU Configure system, edit file "include/STTypes.h" directly and remove the following definition:
#define SOUNDTOUCH_ALLOW_X86_OPTIMIZATIONS 1
2.2.3 Compiling Shared Library / DLL version in Cygwin

The GNU compilation does not automatically create a shared-library version of SoundTouch (.so or .dll). If such is desired, then you can create it as follows after running the usual compilation:

g++ -shared -static -DDLL_EXPORTS -I../../include -o SoundTouch.dll \
     SoundTouchDLL.cpp ../SoundTouch/.libs/libSoundTouch.a
sstrip SoundTouch.dll
2.1. Building in Android

Android compilation instructions are within the source code package, see file "source/Android-lib/README-SoundTouch-Android.html" in the source code package.

The Android compilation automatically builds separate .so library binaries for ARM, X86 and MIPS processor architectures. For optimal device support, include all these .so library binaries into the Android .apk application package, so the target Android device can automatically choose the proper library binary version to use.

The source/Android-lib folder includes also an Android example application that processes WAV audio files using SoundTouch library in Android devices.

3. About implementation & Usage tips

3.1. Supported sample data formats

The sample data format can be chosen between 16bit signed integer and 32bit floating point values. The default is 32bit floating point format, which will also provide slightly better sound quality over the integer format.

In Windows environment, the sample data format is chosen in file "STTypes.h" by choosing one of the following defines:

#define SOUNDTOUCH_INTEGER_SAMPLES for 16bit signed integer
#define SOUNDTOUCH_FLOAT_SAMPLES for 32bit floating point
In GNU environment, the floating sample format is used by default, but integer sample format can be chosen by giving the following switch to the configure script:

./configure --enable-integer-samples
The sample data can have either single (mono) or double (stereo) audio channel. Stereo data is interleaved so that every other data value is for left channel and every second for right channel. Notice that while it'd be possible in theory to process stereo sound as two separate mono channels, this isn't recommended because processing the channels separately would result in losing the phase coherency between the channels, which consequently would ruin the stereo effect.

Sample rates between 8000-48000H are supported.

3.2. Processing latency

The processing and latency constraints of the SoundTouch library are:

Input/output processing latency for the SoundTouch processor is around 100 ms. This is when time-stretching is used. If the rate transposing effect alone is used, the latency requirement is much shorter, see section 'About algorithms'.
Processing CD-quality sound (16bit stereo sound with 44100H sample rate) in real-time or faster is possible starting from processors equivalent to Intel Pentium 133Mh or better, if using the "quick" processing algorithm. If not using the "quick" mode or if floating point sample data are being used, several times more CPU power is typically required.
3.3. About algorithms

SoundTouch provides three seemingly independent effects: tempo, pitch and playback rate control. These three controls are implemented as combination of two primary effects, sample rate transposing and time-stretching.

Sample rate transposing affects both the audio stream duration and pitch. It's implemented simply by converting the original audio sample stream to the  desired duration by interpolating from the original audio samples. In SoundTouch, linear interpolation with anti-alias filtering is used. Theoretically a higher-order interpolation provide better result than 1st order linear interpolation, but in audio application linear interpolation together with anti-alias filtering performs subjectively about as well as higher-order filtering would.

Time-stretching means changing the audio stream duration without affecting it's pitch. SoundTouch uses WSOLA-like time-stretching routines that operate in the time domain. Compared to sample rate transposing, time-stretching is a much heavier operation and also requires a longer processing "window" of sound samples used by the processing algorithm, thus increasing the algorithm input/output latency. Typical i/o latency for the SoundTouch time-stretch algorithm is around 100 ms.

Sample rate transposing and time-stretching are then used together to produce the tempo, pitch and rate controls:

'Tempo' control is implemented purely by time-stretching.
'Rate' control is implemented purely by sample rate transposing.
'Pitch' control is implemented as a combination of time-stretching and sample rate transposing. For example, to increase pitch the audio stream is first time-stretched to longer duration (without affecting pitch) and then transposed back to original duration by sample rate transposing, which simultaneously reduces duration and increases pitch. The result is original duration but increased pitch.
3.4 Tuning the algorithm parameters

The time-stretch algorithm has few parameters that can be tuned to optimize sound quality for certain application. The current default parameters have been chosen by iterative if-then analysis (read: "trial and error") to obtain best subjective sound quality in pop/rock music processing, but in applications processing different kind of sound the default parameter set may result into a sub-optimal result.

The time-stretch algorithm default parameter values are set by the following #defines in file "TDStretch.h":

#define DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS     AUTOMATIC
#define DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS   AUTOMATIC
#define DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS      8
These parameters affect to the time-stretch algorithm as follows:

DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS: This is the default length of a single processing sequence in milliseconds which determines the how the original sound is chopped in the time-stretch algorithm. Larger values mean fewer sequences are used in processing. In principle a larger value sounds better when slowing down the tempo, but worse when increasing the tempo and vice versa. 

By default, this setting value is calculated automatically according to tempo value.
DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS: The seeking window default length in milliseconds is for the algorithm that seeks the best possible overlapping location. This determines from how wide a sample "window" the algorithm can use to find an optimal mixing location when the sound sequences are to be linked back together. 

The bigger this window setting is, the higher the possibility to find a better mixing position becomes, but at the same time large values may cause a "drifting" sound artifact because neighboring sequences can be chosen at more uneven intervals. If there's a disturbing artifact that sounds as if a constant frequency was drifting around, try reducing this setting.

By default, this setting value is calculated automatically according to tempo value.
DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS: Overlap length in milliseconds. When the sound sequences are mixed back together to form again a continuous sound stream, this parameter defines how much the ends of the consecutive sequences will overlap with each other.

This shouldn't be that critical parameter. If you reduce the DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS setting by a large amount, you might wish to try a smaller value on this.
Notice that these parameters can also be set during execution time with functions "TDStretch::setParameters()" and "SoundTouch::setSetting()".

The table below summaries how the parameters can be adjusted for different applications:

Parameter name	Default value magnitude	Larger value affects...	Smaller value affects...	Effect to CPU burden
SEQUENCE_MS
Default value is relatively large, chosen for slowing down music tempo	Larger value is usually better for slowing down tempo. Growing the value decelerates the "echoing" artifact when slowing down the tempo.	Smaller value might be better for speeding up tempo. Reducing the value accelerates the "echoing" artifact when slowing down the tempo	Increasing the parameter value reduces computation burden
SEEKWINDOW_MS
Default value is relatively large, chosen for slowing down music tempo	Larger value eases finding a good mixing position, but may cause a "drifting" artifact	Smaller reduce possibility to find a good mixing position, but reduce the "drifting" artifact.	Increasing the parameter value increases computation burden
OVERLAP_MS
Default value is relatively large, chosen to suit with above parameters.	 	If you reduce the "sequence ms" setting, you might wish to try a smaller value.	Increasing the parameter value increases computation burden
3.5 Performance Optimizations

General optimizations:

The time-stretch routine has a 'quick' mode that substantially speeds up the algorithm but may slightly compromise the sound quality. This mode is activated by calling SoundTouch::setSetting() function with parameter  id of SETTING_USE_QUICKSEEK and value "1", i.e.

setSetting(SETTING_USE_QUICKSEEK, 1);

CPU-specific optimizations:

Intel x86 specific SIMD optimizations are implemented using compiler intrinsics, providing about a 3x processing speedup for x86 compatible processors vs. non-SIMD implementation:

Intel MMX optimized routines are used with x86 CPUs when 16bit integer sample type is used
Intel SSE optimized routines are used with x86 CPUs when 32bit floating point sample type is used
3.5 OpenMP parallel computation

SoundTouch 1.9 onwards support running the algorithms parallel in several CPU cores. Based on benchmark the experienced multi-core processing speed-up gain ranges between +30% (on a high-spec dual-core x86 Windows PC) to 215% (on a moderately low-spec quad-core ARM of Raspberry Pi2).

The parallel computing support is implemented using OpenMP spec 3.0 instructions. These instructions are supported by Visual C++ 2008 and later, and GCC v4.2 and later. Compilers that do not supporting OpenMP will ignore these optimizations and routines will still work properly. Possible warnings about unknown #pragmas are related to OpenMP support and can be safely ignored.

The OpenMP improvements are disabled by default, and need to be enabled by developer during compile-time. Reason for this is that parallel processing adds moderate runtime overhead in managing the multi-threading, so it may not be necessary nor desirable in all applications. For example real-time processing that is not constrained by CPU power will not benefit of speed-up provided by the parallel processing, in the contrary it may increase power consumption due to the increased overhead.

However, applications that run on low-spec multi-core CPUs and may otherwise have possibly constrained performance will benefit of the OpenMP improvements. This include for example multi-core embedded devices.

OpenMP parallel computation can be enabled before compiling SoundTouch library as follows:

Visual Studio: Open properties for the SoundTouch sub-project, browse to C/C++ and Language settings. Set there "OpenMP support" to "Yes". Alternatively add /openmp switch to command-line parameters
GNU: Run the configure script with "./configure --enable-openmp" switch, then run make as usually
Android: Add "-fopenmp" switches to compiler & linker options, see README-SoundTouch-Android.html in the source code package for more detailed instructions.
4. SoundStretch audio processing utility

SoundStretch audio processing utility
Copyright (c) Olli Parviainen 2002-2015

SoundStretch is a simple command-line application that can change tempo, pitch and playback rates of WAV sound files. This program is intended primarily to demonstrate how the "SoundTouch" library can be used to process sound in your own program, but it can as well be used for processing sound files.

4.1. SoundStretch Usage Instructions

SoundStretch Usage syntax:

soundstretch infilename outfilename [switches]
Where:

"infilename"
Name of the input sound data file (in .WAV audio file format). Give "stdin" as filename to use standard input pipe.
"outfilename"
Name of the output sound file where the resulting sound is saved (in .WAV audio file format). This parameter may be omitted if you  don't want to save the output (e.g. when only calculating BPM rate with '-bpm' switch). Give "stdout" as filename to use standard output pipe.
 [switches]
Are one or more control switches.
Available control switches are:

-tempo=n 
Change the sound tempo by n percents (n = -95.0 .. +5000.0 %)
-pitch=n
Change the sound pitch by n semitones (n = -60.0 .. + 60.0 semitones)
-rate=n
Change the sound playback rate by n percents (n = -95.0 .. +5000.0 %)
-bpm=n
Detect the Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) rate of the sound and adjust the tempo to meet 'n' BPMs. When this switch is applied, the "-tempo" switch is ignored. If "=n" is omitted, i.e. switch "-bpm" is used alone, then the BPM rate is estimated and displayed, but tempo not adjusted according to the BPM value.
-quick
Use quicker tempo change algorithm. Gains speed but loses sound quality.
-naa
Don't use anti-alias filtering in sample rate transposing. Gains speed but loses sound quality.
-license
Displays the program license text (LGPL)
Notes:

To use standard input/output pipes for processing, give "stdin" and "stdout" as input/output filenames correspondingly. The standard input/output pipes will still carry the audio data in .wav audio file format.
The numerical switches allow both integer (e.g. "-tempo=123") and decimal (e.g. "-tempo=123.45") numbers.
The "-naa" and/or "-quick" switches can be used to reduce CPU usage while compromising some sound quality
The BPM detection algorithm works by detecting repeating bass or drum patterns at low frequencies of <250Hz. A lower-than-expected BPM figure may be reported for music with uneven or complex bass patterns.
4.2. SoundStretch usage examples

Example 1

The following command increases tempo of the sound file "originalfile.wav" by 12.5% and stores result to file "destinationfile.wav":

soundstretch originalfile.wav destinationfile.wav -tempo=12.5
Example 2

The following command decreases the sound pitch (key) of the sound file "orig.wav" by two semitones and stores the result to file "dest.wav":

soundstretch orig.wav dest.wav -pitch=-2
Example 3

The following command processes the file "orig.wav" by decreasing the sound tempo by 25.3% and increasing the sound pitch (key) by 1.5 semitones. Resulting .wav audio data is directed to standard output pipe:

soundstretch orig.wav stdout -tempo=-25.3 -pitch=1.5
Example 4

The following command detects the BPM rate of the file "orig.wav" and adjusts the tempo to match 100 beats per minute. Result is stored to file "dest.wav":

soundstretch orig.wav dest.wav -bpm=100
Example 5

The following command reads .wav sound data from standard input pipe and estimates the BPM rate:

soundstretch stdin -bpm
Example 6

The following command tunes song from original 440Hz tuning to 432Hz tuning: this corresponds to lowering the pitch by -0.318 semitones:

soundstretch original.wav output.wav -pitch=-0.318

Added adaptive integer divider scaling for improved sound quality when using integer processing algorithm
1.9:

Added support for parallel computation support via OpenMP primitives for better performance in multicore systems. Benchmarks show that achieved parallel processing speedup improvement typically range from +30% (x86 dual-core) to +180% (ARM quad-core).
